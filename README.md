# Classification-and-Regression-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-SVM

This is the extended version of handwritten digit classification done earlier. Implemented Logistic Regression 
and use the Support Vector Machine tool in sklearn.svm.SVM to classify hand-written digit images and compared 
the performance of these methods.

# Task -

 - Implemented Logistic Regression and gave the prediction results.
 - Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) toolbox to perform classification.
 - Implemented the direct minimization of multi-class Logistic Regression (using softmax function).
